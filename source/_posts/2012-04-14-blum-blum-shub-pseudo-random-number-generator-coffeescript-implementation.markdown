This weekend hasn't been as busy as they have been lately, so I've had a lot more time to just sit around. I was reading some articles on PRNGs, and a PRNG I've never heard of caught my eye. Mainly, I think, because of its name. [Blum Blum Shub](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blum_Blum_Shub) is a PRNG devised by some mathematicians and computer scientists in the mid 1980's. I decided to do a Coffeescript implementation of it.
